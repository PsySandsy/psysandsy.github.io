# Introduction 

The book [The Psychology of Performance](https://www.routledge.com/The-Psychology-of-Performance-1st-Edition/Cotterill/p/book/9781138219205) by Stewart T Cotterill explores

> ...the way the mind works (or needs to work) to be able to perform at a high level when it counts time after time. 

--

Chapter 5 - `Factors determining psychological performance` - details tips and techniques identified via psychological research that leads to enhanced performance. But also uncovers factors that diminish performance. 

--

I was so enthralled by this chapter, I decided to summarise it here. With the factors that determine performance documented, we can use this knowledge to consistently deliver high performance in present and future environments. To start hitting the mark like Jim Bowen, let's first uncover the factors residing in you - as an individual - which determine performance...

name: indiv-fac

# Individual Factors
```{r indiv-table, echo=FALSE}
indiv_table <- data.frame(FACTOR = c("Mindset", "Optimal Mindset", "Effective Coping Strategies", "Goal Setting", "Relaxation and Meditation", "Imagery/Self-Talk"), DETAIL = c("A growth mindset outperforms a fixed mindset. Folks with this mindset focus on learning, their invested effort will lead to success, and they embrace their mistakes.", "One in which you achieve FLOW. To increase the likelihood of experiencing this, motivate yourself to perform well, achieve an optimal physiological arousal level prior to performance, and have a strong focus", "Handle pressure of situation by reinterpreting it. More detail is given later.", "Set SMART goals to guide performance and change behavior if performance is dipping.", "Enhances well-being and handles stress. You can also use this as a coping strategy.", "Pre-imaging situations is conducive to performance in those situations."))

# Psychological skills to facilitate performance

Many of these individual factors are called [Psychological skills](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/psychological-skills-training.htm). These are cognitive skills designed to enhance performance outcomes, increase enjoyment, and enhance satisfaction. The main ones to develop are:

--

 1. Goal-setting
 2. Relaxation and Meditation
 3. Imagery
 4. Self-talk
 5. Pre-performance rituals

--

Not too sure how to develop them? Have no fear, I'll show you how in the next few slides...

---
name: goal

# Goal setting

**Goal-setting:** setting goals has consistently lead to enhanced performance. Influences behavior and motivation. Should be [_SMART_ (specific, measurable, action-related, realistic, timetabled)](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm). Most important aspect is evaluation and re-evaluation, allowing monitoring and behavioral change (if required).

--

Within work, our objectives are advised to be written in the SMART format. If you want to improve performance within work, create SMART goals with your line manager.

SMART goals - being specific and realistic - allow you to focus on things you can improve. Are you training for a race? Add 5 minutes onto your next run. Learning a new language? Learn a new word a day. Have you got a band performance coming up? Busk once a week to get used to crowds etc.

# Relaxation & meditation

We spend a third of a day - every day - sleeping. I.E. **resting**. The importance of rest is hard-coded into our body clock. 

If our bodies need consistent rest, so do we when we're performing. Thankfully, both relaxation and meditation provide such rest:

--

.pull-left[
**Relaxation and meditation:** two types, ‘muscle to mind’ (involving breathing exercises and muscular relaxation approach) and ‘mind to muscle’ (meditation and autogenic training). Both aim to decrease oxygen consumption, reduce heart rate & respiration, and provide controlled focus of attention. Can be developed in meditation groups, or by using meditation apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) or [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/).

**Mindfulness** - in particular - can increase well-being and improve functioning in healthy people, and [is effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735813000731) 
]

# Imagery and Self-talk

Picturing or imagining specific scenarios is effective for skill learning, preparation for performance, and rehabilitation. You can deploy several senses and experience the situation as if it were real. Mental imagery improves with practice. Most successful performers use frequent imagery. 

--

Self-talk are cognitive techniques that use specific verbal cues to activate appropriate responses (mostly used in sports settings for learners to talk through specific motor movements, and then to motivate themselves through challenging tasks). As this is your inner voice, you have the ability to change it from disparaging ("How could I be so stupid") to encouraging ("Huh... I didn't know that. I'll remember that next time.")

--

With individual factors covered, let's turn to factors that determine performance when you work as part of a team...

---
name: team-fac
# Team Factors Determining Performance

```{r {r team-table, echo = FALSE}
team_table <- data.frame(FACTOR = c("Role Clarity", "Leadership", "Cohesion", "Team emotion"), DETAIL = c("Denotes team members knowing what their roles are. Also requires role acceptance and role performance. Members also need to understand roles of other members, and this understanding has to be the same between all members.", "Influencing individuals and groups toward specific goals. Good leaders are good planners, organisers, and decision makers, and are able to empower others to action.", "Togetherness of the team. Can be either task (united in pursuit of goals), or social (united in their social interactions).", "Team members are aware of emotional climate in the team, and may modify their moods to that climate."))

# Factors Limiting Performance 

The previous factors may enhance performance, but there's also a few that diminish it. Identify these devils, and eliminate them:

--

 1. Lack of quality and/or quantity of sleep
 2. Tiredness
 3. Performance usually decreases after a midday meal, ‘post-lunch dip’
 4. Perceived stress - this will lead to ‘deautomisation’ of learnt skills, over-thinking, and ‘paralysis by analysis’.

--

Given these hazards, let's uncover ways to combat them...
 
---
name: cope
# Coping

Coping relates to handling stress of situation, setbacks, and stress experienced whilst under pressure. 

--

Most important strategy to cope is to reinterpret the situation to reduce or eliminate the stress evoked from it. Your concept of pressure is self-determined, usually from expectation of others. If you change these expectations, you can reduce pressure you feel, allowing freedom for performance to flourish. 

--

For example, if you sit an exam, the act of writing answers to questions on a piece of paper is not stressful on its own. Instead, the pressure _you_ bring to that exam is stressful. Your parents _expecting you_ to get high marks is stressful. Worrying about _your friends_ getting higher marks is stressful. Worrying about not getting onto a course _you want_ is stressful. 

--

If you identify these factors as the source of stress, you can reassess them, eliminate them, and free up more thinking time to perform. 

---

# Coping strategies

Aside from reinterpreting your situation, there is a multitude of other strategies and resources to cope with a stressful situation. 

Specifically, you can deploy problem-focused or emotion-focused coping. 

--

Problem-focused look at changing the problems causing distress, usually by problem-solving and increased effort.

.pull-right[
Emotion-focused regulate your emotional response to problems causing distress

name: coping-resources

# Coping resources

Plus, despite which coping strategy you employ, you can use a lot of resources. 

--

Good quality sleep

--

High - or improving - fitness levels 

--

Healthy nutrition and hydration

--

Time management

--

Strong social support. Social support is the most important, as it’s been linked to enhanced well-being. Keep in touch with you family and friends. Tell them how you feel. Sociliase.

At the very least, if you have a problem, voice it to your support network; and prove [Donald Winnicott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott) wrong:

> The Englishman does not want to be upset, to be reminded that there are personal tragedies all over the place, that he is really not happy in himself.

???

Plus, a high carbohydrate breakfast can improve morning performance. If you feel performance is needed before lunch, grab a McMuffan!

# Summary

We have looked at multiple dimensions of the psychology of performance:

* [The individual factors that determine performance;](#indiv-fac)
* [The team factors that determine performance;](#team-fac)
* [The factors that limit performance; and,](#fac-lim)
* [Coping strategies to handle stressful situations](#cope)

Now that we've explored these, let's finish on two summary slides for ease of reference. 

---
name: mindset

# Advice on your mindset

This first summary slide advises on the specific mindset you bring to situations. 

--

  1. Developing a *growth mindset* is better in the long run

--

  2. Effort is key to future success. The more you put in, the more you _generally_ get out. 

--

  3. If you know your mindset when you perform well, you can take steps to achieve that mindset more often. 

--

  4. Stay mentally sharp by having a healthy diet and good hydration. Eat your fruit and vegetables; keep red meat fast food, and alcohol to a minimum; drink lots of tea and water etc. 

--

  5. Psychological skills help performance (goal-setting, imagery, relaxation etc). The more you practice them, the better they become

name: tips
# Practical tips to enhance performance

Whilst in this second and last one, if you want ten pithy rules to slap on your wall for enhanced performance, *viola*:

--
 
 1. Become an optimist, rather than a pessimist
 2. Practice and performance are positively related - more you put in, more you’ll get out
 3. Replicate what you do when things go well

--
 4. Treat good quality sleep as vital.
 5. Set SMART goals
 6. Develop relaxation and mindfulness skills

--
 7. Make self-talk positive and supportive
 8. Develop a routine for pre-performance - it gives you something to think about and blocks any unwanted thoughts.
 9. In teams, make sure everyone knows what they’re doing, and that everyone has the same understanding
 10. Be aware of how your emotions impact upon performance (individual and team) and understand how to create your preferred response (excited rather than nervous)
