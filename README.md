Presentation showcasing the benefits of using R and Git for analytical work. Usage of both software programs can enact automation and efficiency after DfE's [Explore Education Statistics](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/explore-education-statistics) has launched in late 2019.

### xaringan

This presentation was created from the [xaringan package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) in R. Once I got used to it, I found it more efficient and effective than either Powerpoint or Keynote. If you learn R, you can also learn xaringan to add data and charts into your presentations easily, as well as let your presentations be version controlled by Git.
