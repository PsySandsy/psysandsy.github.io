This page hosts presentations I have given to professional audiences. 

## The Psychology of Performance

This is a presentation summarising Chapter 5 of [The Psychology of Performance:](https://www.routledge.com/The-Psychology-of-Performance/Cotterill/p/book/9781138219205) `Factors determining psychological performance`

The presentation [is here](https://psysandsy.github.io/psy-of-perform.html). 

## The Boons of R and Git

This showcases the benefits of using R and Git for analytical work. Usage of both software programs can enact automation and efficiency after DfE's [Explore Education Statistics](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/explore-education-statistics) is launched.   

The presentation [is here](https://psysandsy.github.io/boons-r-git.html). 

## xaringan Teach

This teaches you how to create a xaringan presentation, and gives examples of its capabilities. 

The presentation [is here](https://psysandsy.github.io/xaringan-teach.html).

### xaringan

Both these presentations were created from the [xaringan package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) in R. Once I got used to it, I found it more efficient and effective than either Powerpoint or Keynote. If you learn R, you can also learn xaringan to add data and charts into your presentations easily, as well as let your presentations be version controlled by Git.
